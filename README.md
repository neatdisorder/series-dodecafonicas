### Twelve-Tone Row Generator

This is a small website I created that generates random twelve-tone rows for practicing **Javascript** and **Bootstrap**. Texts are in Spanish only.

A twelve-tone row is basically a series of twelve notes which is used for composing atonal music. This websites generates random series and three different variations.

For more information on twelve-tone music, [please check the entry on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique).
